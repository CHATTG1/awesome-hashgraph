## Official Swirlds

First see [Official "SDK"](http://www.swirlds.com/download/) which is the official Swirlds "SDK". Includes the swirlds.jar and a number of sample Applications.

* [lbaird/swirlds-demos](https://github.com/lbaird/swirlds-demos) - sample applications demonstrating specific functions of the the Hashgraph platform. Official SDK is required to run.

## Development Tools

### IDEs

* [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/oxygen1a) - most popular IDE for Java. Some integration with the SDK.
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) - best looking IDE for Java.

## Reference Hashgraph projects

* [Exo-Demo](https://github.com/craigdrabiktxmq/exo-demo) This project contains a demonstration of a web application communicating with a Swirld. The application tracks lions, tigers, and bears in a zoo. Users can add animals to the zoo and see the updated state. The zoo state is tracked in a Swirld, and adding an animal executes a transaction on the Swirld.
