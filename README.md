## Reference Hashgraph projects

* [Hyperledger Mercury](https://github.com/hashgraph/hyperledger-mercury) This is a community driven open source project geared at building a Hyperledger stack on top of the Swirlds platform.
* [Exo-Demo](https://github.com/craigdrabiktxmq/exo-demo) This project contains a demonstration of a web application communicating with a Swirld. The application tracks lions, tigers, and bears in a zoo. Users can add animals to the zoo and see the updated state. The zoo state is tracked in a Swirld, and adding an animal executes a transaction on the Swirld.
