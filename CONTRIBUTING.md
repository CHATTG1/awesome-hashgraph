# Contributing

Do you want to contribute? That would be great!

My goal is to curate all of the most useful Hashgraph resources and tools that are stable and useful.

## How?

If you want to add an entry to the `README.md` please consider this:

- is the entry valuable to people trying to get things done on Hashgraph?
- if yes, use the template `[XXX/YYY](https://github.com/XXX/YYY) â€” DESCRIPTION [<img src="https://travis-ci.org/XXX/YYY.svg?branch=master">](https://travis-ci.org/XXX/YYY)`
- pay attention to the alphabetical ordering
